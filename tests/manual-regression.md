# Manual regression checks

## Active item metadata after playlist reorder

1. Create a local-video playlist with at least `A`, `B`, and `C`; start `B`.
2. Reorder the playlist or insert an item before `B`, without changing `B`'s playlist ID or target.
3. Press Next, then press Stop before the new item completes its cut.
4. Restart Current File.

Expected: the current logical item is `B`, including when `B` is a folder item. A duplicate path elsewhere in the playlist must not be selected instead.

## Always Play while hidden

1. Create a local-video playlist `A -> B -> C` and choose **Always Play even when not visible**.
2. Show the source while `A` starts, then hide it.
3. Wait longer than the combined duration of `A` and `B`.
4. Show the source again.

Expected: playback has advanced into the expected position of `B` or `C`; it is not stopped on `B`'s preloaded first frame. Repeat after changing the playlist/current target while hidden, with Pause/Unpause selected, to confirm the source remains paused until shown.
